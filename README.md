 Binary Search Program

 Description

This program implements the **Binary Search** algorithm in Python to efficiently search for a target value within a sorted list. 
The Binary Search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the list into halves and narrowing down the search range until the target value is found or the search space is exhausted.

 Features

- Prompts the user to input a range of numbers to generate a sorted list.
- Uses Binary Search to find the index of a specified target number within the sorted list.
- Outputs the index of the target value if found, or a message stating that the target was not found.
